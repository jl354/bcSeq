Description: This Rcpp-based package implements a highly efficient
    data structure and algorithm for performing alignment of short
    reads from CRISPR or shRNA screens to reference barcode library. 
    Sequencing error are considered and matching
    qualities are evaluated based on Phred scores. A Bayes'
    classifier is employed to predict the originating barcode of a
    read. The package supports provision of user-defined probability
    models for evaluating matching qualities. The package also
    supports multi-threading.
